TREBORS ATARI 2600 ONLY PALETTES:

UNCALIBRATED = Raw luminance values.

CALIBRATED = Luminance calibrated per official utility and diagnostic tools.

MODIFIED = Modified luminance for modern displays, accounts for some picture processing features.

SUPER = Superior luminance and saturation.

GAMMASAT1 = Increased luminance base, retain calibration, default saturation.

GAMMASAT2 = Increased luminance base, retain calibration, substantial saturation increase.

GAMMASAT3 = Increased luminance base, retain calibration, proportionally increased saturation.

LUM1 = Minimal luminance range without darkest hues appearing black.

LUM2 = Lowered luminance range containing decreased luminance values.

LUM3 = Widest luminance range and max luminance values while avoiding washout.
