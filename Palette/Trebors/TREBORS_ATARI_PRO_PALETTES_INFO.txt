\\(1) Region\(2) Luminance Setting\(3) Palette Temperature

(1) NTSC | PAL
(2) UNCALIBRATED | CALIBRATED | MODIFIED | SUPER
(3) COOL (25.7) | WARM (26.7) | HOT (27.7)

UNCALIBRATED = Raw luminance values.
Ideal Usage: Tap, unmodified RF Video observations.

CALIBRATED = Luminance calibrated per official utility and diagnostic tools.
Ideal Usage: CRT display viewing.

MODIFIED = Modified luminance for modern displays, accounts for some picture processing features.
Ideal Usage: Modern display viewing.

SUPER = Superior luminance and saturation.
Ideal Usage: Showcase and Showroom viewing.

GAMMASAT1 = Increased luminance base, retain calibration, default saturation.
Ideal Usage: Desiring a bright picture and modest color saturation.

GAMMASAT2 = Increased luminance base, retain calibration, substantial saturation increase.
Ideal Usage: Desiring a bright picture with a boost to saturation.

GAMMASAT3 = Increased luminance base, retain calibration, proportionally increased saturation.
Ideal Usage: Desiring a bright picture coupled by well saturated colors.
